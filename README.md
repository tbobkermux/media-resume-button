# Add a resume button to your video player

This web component overlays two buttons on your video player when you pause the video. 
The buttons enable you to either resume the video from the last viewed position, or play from the start. 

## Example below

```
<media-resume-button player="video-player" playbackid="OYWW4ZbsI93B00vrQkMCc7nhNJ9Hb011qyjGjZElC01Zz8" />
```

## Run a demo
Install the live-server package using ``` yarn install ```
Use the ``` yarn start ``` to start the local http server that will launch the demo.
